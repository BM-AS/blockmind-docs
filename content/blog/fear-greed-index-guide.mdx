# How to Read a Fear & Greed Index (And When to Ignore It)

The Fear & Greed Index measures crypto market sentiment on a scale of 0-100. Low scores mean fear (people are selling), high scores mean greed (people are buying). It's useful for understanding market psychology — but it won't tell you when to buy or sell.

## What the Numbers Mean

| Score | Label | Market Mood |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 0-24 | Extreme Fear | Panic, capitulation, possible bottom |
| 25-44 | Fear | Uncertainty, caution, risk-off |
| 45-55 | Neutral | Balanced, no strong bias |
| 56-74 | Greed | Optimism, confidence, risk-on |
| 75-100 | Extreme Greed | Euphoria, FOMO, possible top |

## How It's Calculated

The index combines multiple data sources:

| Factor | Weight | What It Measures |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| Volatility | 25% | Price swings vs historical averages |
| Momentum | 25% | Volume and price trends |
| Social Media | 15% | Crypto mentions and engagement |
| Dominance | 10% | Bitcoin's market share |
| Trends | 10% | Google search volume |
| Surveys | 15% | Weekly sentiment polls |

The weights and exact methodology vary by provider, but the concept is the same: aggregate multiple sentiment signals into one number.

## The Contrarian Approach

The classic wisdom: "Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful."

In practice:
- **Extreme Fear (0-24)** → Often a buying opportunity
- **Extreme Greed (75-100)** → Often a time to reduce exposure

This contrarian approach has historical support. Major market bottoms often coincide with extreme fear. Major tops often coincide with extreme greed.

### Historical Examples

**March 2020 (COVID crash):**
- Fear & Greed hit single digits
- Bitcoin dropped to $4,000
- Those who bought saw 15x gains within 18 months

**November 2021 (market top):**
- Fear & Greed above 80 for weeks
- Bitcoin at $69,000
- Followed by 70%+ drawdown

## When to Ignore It

Here's where most guides stop. But the Fear & Greed Index has real limitations:

### 1. It Can Stay Extreme for Weeks

Markets can remain "irrational" longer than you expect. Extreme fear doesn't mean the bottom is in. Extreme greed doesn't mean a crash is imminent.

**Example:** During the 2022 bear market, the index stayed in fear territory for months. Buying at "extreme fear" in May would have meant holding through another 50% drop.

### 2. It's a Lagging Indicator

The index measures current sentiment, not future price. By the time it shows extreme fear, prices have already fallen. By the time it shows extreme greed, prices have already risen.

### 3. Context Matters More Than the Number

An extreme fear reading during a long-term bull market is different from extreme fear during a structural bear market. The number alone doesn't tell you which one you're in.

### 4. It Ignores Fundamentals

Sentiment can be wrong. The market might be euphoric for good reasons (genuine adoption, improving fundamentals). Or fearful for good reasons (protocol exploit, regulatory crackdown).

### 5. Short-Term Noise

Daily readings fluctuate based on news cycles. A single tweet can spike or crash sentiment temporarily. Weekly or monthly trends are more meaningful than daily readings.

## How to Use It Properly

### 1. Combine with Other Indicators

Fear & Greed is one input, not the answer. Use it alongside:
- BTC Dominance (risk appetite)
- On-chain metrics (actual holder behavior)
- Technical analysis (price levels)
- Your own research

### 2. Focus on Extremes

The middle range (30-70) isn't very useful. Pay attention when readings are truly extreme — below 20 or above 80.

### 3. Look at Trends, Not Snapshots

A reading of 25 after weeks of 60+ is different from 25 after weeks of 15. The direction matters as much as the level.

### 4. Size Positions Accordingly

Rather than going all-in based on sentiment:
- Extreme fear → Consider adding gradually
- Extreme greed → Consider taking some profits
- Neutral → Stick to your plan

### 5. Never Use It Alone

The index tells you how others feel. It doesn't tell you if they're right. Do your own research.

## The Biggest Mistake

The biggest mistake is treating Fear & Greed as a trading signal. "The index is at 15, time to buy everything!"

Sentiment indicators help you understand the environment. They don't replace analysis, risk management, or patience.

Use it to:
- Gut-check your own emotions (Am I being greedy when others are?)
- Understand market context
- Identify possible turning points (not certainties)

Don't use it to:
- Time exact entries and exits
- Override fundamental analysis
- Make binary buy/sell decisions
