# Interpreting DeepDive Reports

A DeepDive report contains a lot of information. Here's how to extract actionable insights.

## Reading the Summary First

Every report starts with a summary. This gives you:
- **Quick verdict** — Bullish, bearish, or neutral outlook
- **Key strengths** — What's working for this project
- **Key concerns** — What could go wrong
- **Action points** — Suggested next steps

If you're short on time, the summary often tells you what you need to know.

## Evaluating Market Data

### Market Cap Categories

| Market Cap | Category | What It Means |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| Over $10B | Large Cap | Established, lower risk, lower upside |
| $1B-$10B | Mid Cap | Growing, moderate risk/reward |
| $100M-$1B | Small Cap | Higher risk, higher potential |
| Under $100M | Micro Cap | Very high risk, speculative |

### Volume Analysis

- **Volume/Market Cap above 10%** — High activity, very liquid
- **Volume/Market Cap 1-10%** — Normal trading activity
- **Volume/Market Cap below 1%** — Low activity, be careful with large positions

### Price Context

- Compare current price to all-time high
- Check how far from recent highs/lows
- Look at price change over multiple timeframes

## Understanding On-Chain Data

### Holder Distribution

| Top 10 Holders | Interpretation |
|----------------|----------------|
| Under 20% | Highly distributed, lower dump risk |
| 20-50% | Moderately concentrated |
| Over 50% | Highly concentrated, whale risk |

**Note:** Always exclude exchange wallets and known burn addresses from this analysis.

### Transaction Trends

- **Rising transactions** — Growing usage and interest
- **Falling transactions** — Declining activity
- **Spiky transactions** — Often speculation-driven

### Smart Money Signals

When sophisticated wallets accumulate or distribute:
- Accumulating = Potential bullish signal
- Distributing = Potential bearish signal

Remember: Smart money isn't always right.

## Reading Technical Levels

### Support Levels

Support is where buyers historically step in:
- **Strong support** — Multiple bounces at this level
- **Weak support** — Only tested once or twice
- **Breaking support** — Bearish signal

### Resistance Levels

Resistance is where sellers historically appear:
- **Strong resistance** — Multiple rejections
- **Weak resistance** — Tested briefly
- **Breaking resistance** — Bullish signal

### What to Do With Levels

- Consider buying near support
- Consider taking profits near resistance
- Use levels to set stop losses
- Don't treat levels as guarantees

## Weighing Risk Factors

DeepDive highlights risks. Here's how to evaluate them:

### High Severity Risks
- Very concentrated holdings
- Anonymous team with large allocation
- No audit on smart contracts
- Declining user metrics

### Medium Severity Risks
- High correlation to Bitcoin
- Limited trading venues
- Short track record
- Competitive market

### Lower Severity Risks
- Price volatility (expected in crypto)
- Regulatory uncertainty (affects all crypto)
- Market conditions (external factor)

## Developing Your Own Thesis

A DeepDive is a starting point. Build your thesis by asking:

1. **Do I understand what this project does?**
   - If no, research more or skip it

2. **Why would this token increase in value?**
   - Use case growth? Token utility? Speculation?

3. **What would prove my thesis wrong?**
   - Identify your exit triggers

4. **What's my time horizon?**
   - Day trade? Swing? Long-term hold?

5. **How much am I willing to lose?**
   - Position size accordingly

## Common Mistakes

### Over-relying on DeepDive
- It's AI analysis, not a crystal ball
- Always do additional research
- Consider what the report might miss

### Ignoring Red Flags
- Every token has risks
- Don't dismiss warnings that conflict with your hopes
- The risk section exists for a reason

### Analysis Paralysis
- You don't need perfect information
- Make decisions with incomplete data
- Set rules and follow them

## Combining Multiple Reports

For best results:
1. Run DeepDives on competing tokens
2. Compare metrics side by side
3. Look for outliers (good and bad)
4. Consider which fits your strategy
