# Security & Privacy

BlockMind is designed with security-first principles. Your data stays private, your funds stay safe, and you stay in control.

## Our Security Model

### Read-Only Access

BlockMind operates on a **read-only model**. When you connect a wallet or enter an address:

- We can **view** your public wallet address
- We can **read** your on-chain balances
- We **cannot** move funds, sign transactions, or access private keys

Think of BlockMind like a blockchain explorer that knows which addresses to watch. We see the same public data anyone can see on-chain — we just present it in a useful way.

### What We Can't Do

BlockMind has **no ability** to:

- Access your private keys or seed phrases
- Sign transactions on your behalf
- Move or transfer any funds
- Approve smart contract interactions
- Access your wallet beyond your public address

Even if BlockMind were compromised, attackers could not access your funds because we never have that access to begin with.

## Data Protection

### Encryption

All data in transit uses TLS 1.3 encryption (HTTPS). Your connection to BlockMind is always encrypted.

### Data Storage

We store:
- **Email address**: For authentication only
- **Wallet addresses**: To track your portfolios
- **Portfolio preferences**: Your settings and watchlists
- **Usage analytics**: Anonymous product improvement data

We do **not** store:
- Private keys (we never see them)
- Seed phrases (we never see them)
- Transaction signing capabilities
- Passwords (we use passwordless auth)

### Data Retention

Your data is retained while your account is active. When you delete your account, all associated data is permanently removed within 30 days.

## Privacy Practices

### No Data Sales

We do not sell your personal information. Period.

### No Cross-Site Tracking

We don't track you across the web. Our analytics are limited to understanding how people use BlockMind.

### No Third-Party Data Sharing

We don't share your portfolio data with third parties. Your holdings are visible only to you.

### Private by Default

All portfolios are private. Only you can see your holdings and watchlists.

## Authentication Security

### Passwordless Login

BlockMind uses email-based magic links instead of passwords. Benefits:

- **No password to steal**: Phishing-resistant authentication
- **No password to forget**: Just check your email
- **Session-based**: Each login creates a fresh session

### Session Management

- Sessions expire after inactivity
- You can log out from all devices
- Each device gets a unique session token

## Wallet Connection Security

### WalletConnect Protocol

We use WalletConnect, an industry-standard protocol for connecting wallets to dApps. When you connect:

1. Your wallet shows what permissions are requested
2. You approve the connection
3. BlockMind receives only your public address

### What the Connection Allows

A wallet connection gives BlockMind permission to:
- View your public wallet address
- View your public balance (same as any block explorer)

A wallet connection does **not** allow:
- Transaction signing
- Fund transfers
- Any write operations

## Common Security Questions

### Can BlockMind steal my crypto?

**No.** We have read-only access to public wallet data. We cannot sign transactions or move funds.

### Is WalletConnect safe?

Yes. WalletConnect is an open-source protocol used by hundreds of applications. It only shares your public address unless you explicitly approve additional permissions.

### What if BlockMind gets hacked?

Even in a worst-case scenario, attackers could only see public wallet addresses — the same information available to anyone on the blockchain. No private keys or funds are at risk.

### Should I use a hardware wallet?

Yes! Hardware wallets add an extra layer of security for significant holdings. BlockMind works perfectly with hardware wallets — you just connect and we read your public address.

### Can I use BlockMind anonymously?

You need an email to create an account, but you can use any email service including privacy-focused ones. Your wallet addresses are never publicly linked to your email.
