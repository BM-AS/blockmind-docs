## Adding Tokens

## Watchlist Strategies

Here are some ways other users organize their watchlists:

| Watchlist Name | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|
| "Next Buy" | Tokens I'm ready to buy at the right price |
| "Research" | Tokens I'm still analyzing |
| "Competitors" | Tokens similar to ones I hold |
| "Airdrops" | Projects that might airdrop to users |
| "Red Flags" | Tokens I'm avoiding (to remember why) |
