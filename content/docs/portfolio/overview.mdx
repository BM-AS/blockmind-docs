# Portfolio Overview

Your BlockMind portfolio shows all crypto holdings in one dashboard with real-time values, 24h changes, and per-token breakdowns. Connect multiple wallets across Ethereum, Solana, and other chains to see everything in one place.

## What You'll See

When you open your portfolio, you'll find:

### Holdings Summary
- **Total Value** — Your portfolio's current USD value
- **24h Change** — How much your portfolio changed in the last day
- **Holdings List** — All tokens you own, sorted by value

### Individual Token View
For each token in your portfolio:
- Current price and 24h change
- Your balance and USD value
- Quick access to DeepDive analysis

## Creating Portfolios

You can create multiple portfolios to organize your holdings:

- **By wallet** — One portfolio per wallet address
- **By strategy** — Group holdings by investment thesis (e.g., "Blue Chips", "DeFi", "Speculation")
- **By timeframe** — Separate long-term holds from trading positions

### Steps to Create
1. Go to **Portfolio** in the sidebar
2. Click **New Portfolio** or **Import Wallet**
3. Choose a name and add your holdings

## Managing Holdings

### Adding Holdings
- **Connect a wallet** — Automatically imports all tokens
- **Paste an address** — Scan any public wallet
- **Manual entry** — Add tokens without connecting

### Editing Holdings
- Click any token to view details
- Update quantities manually if needed
- Remove tokens you no longer hold

## Portfolio Privacy

Your portfolios are **private by default**:
- Only you can see your holdings
- Wallet connections are read-only
- We never have access to your private keys

## Tips for Better Tracking

1. **Use descriptive names** — "Ledger ETH" is clearer than "Portfolio 1"
2. **Regular updates** — Re-scan wallets periodically for accuracy
3. **Separate concerns** — Don't mix trading and holding wallets
4. **Check spam filters** — Some low-value tokens may be hidden

## Next Steps

- [Connect a wallet](/docs/getting-started/connect-wallet) to import holdings
- [Set up a watchlist](/docs/portfolio/watchlists) to track tokens you don't own
- [Generate a DeepDive](/docs/deepdive/getting-started) report on any token
