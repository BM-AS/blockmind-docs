# Market Overview

The Market page gives you a bird's-eye view of crypto market conditions through four key indicators.

## Market Indicators

BlockMind tracks four essential metrics to help you understand market sentiment:

### Fear & Greed Index

The Fear & Greed Index measures overall market sentiment on a scale of 0-100:

| Score | Sentiment | What It Means |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| 0-25 | Extreme Fear | Market is very pessimistic — often a buying opportunity |
| 25-45 | Fear | Uncertainty is high, investors are cautious |
| 45-55 | Neutral | Market is balanced |
| 55-75 | Greed | Optimism is building, prices rising |
| 75-100 | Extreme Greed | Market is euphoric — often a selling signal |

**Data sources:** Volatility, market momentum, social media sentiment, Bitcoin dominance, and Google Trends.

### Altcoin Season Index

Measures whether altcoins or Bitcoin is leading the market:

- **0-25** — Bitcoin Season (BTC outperforming most altcoins)
- **25-75** — Mixed market
- **75-100** — Altcoin Season (altcoins outperforming BTC)

**Why it matters:** During Bitcoin seasons, holding BTC often beats altcoins. During altcoin seasons, diversifying into quality altcoins can boost returns.

### BTC Dominance

Shows Bitcoin's share of the total crypto market cap:

- **High dominance (above 50%)** — Bitcoin is the safe haven; investors are risk-off
- **Low dominance (below 40%)** — Money flowing to altcoins; investors are risk-on

**Historical context:**
- 2017 peak: BTC dominance fell below 35% during altcoin mania
- 2018-2019 bear: BTC dominance rose above 70%
- Current: Typically ranges 40-55%

### Contrarian Index

BlockMind's proprietary indicator combining multiple signals to identify potential market turning points:

- **Buy Signal** — Indicators suggest the market may be oversold
- **Neutral** — No strong contrarian signal
- **Sell Signal** — Indicators suggest the market may be overbought

**Note:** This is not financial advice. Use as one input among many in your decision-making.

## How to Use Market Data

### For Portfolio Decisions

1. **Extreme Fear** — Consider it a potential buying opportunity
2. **Extreme Greed** — Consider taking some profits
3. **Altcoin Season** — Review altcoin allocation
4. **Bitcoin Season** — Consider consolidating to BTC

### For Timing

- Don't try to time the market perfectly
- Use indicators as confirmation, not primary signals
- Combine with your own research and DeepDive analysis

### For Risk Management

- Higher greed = tighter stop losses
- Higher fear = wider accumulation ranges
- Monitor BTC dominance for sector rotation signals
