# How Indicators Work

This page explains the methodology behind each market indicator. Understanding how they're calculated helps you use them more effectively.

## Fear & Greed Index

The Fear & Greed Index measures overall crypto market sentiment on a 0-100 scale.

### Data Sources

We aggregate data from multiple sources:

| Factor | Weight | What It Measures |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| Volatility | 25% | Unusual price swings vs 30/90-day averages |
| Market Momentum | 25% | Volume and price momentum vs averages |
| Social Media | 15% | Crypto mentions, hashtags, engagement rates |
| Dominance | 10% | Bitcoin's share of total market cap |
| Trends | 10% | Google search volume for crypto terms |
| Surveys | 15% | Weekly polling of market participants |

### Calculation

1. Each factor is normalized to a 0-100 scale
2. Weighted average produces the final index
3. Updated every few hours

### Interpretation

| Score | Label | Market Behavior |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| 0-25 | Extreme Fear | Panic selling, potential capitulation |
| 25-45 | Fear | Cautious, risk-off sentiment |
| 45-55 | Neutral | Balanced, no strong bias |
| 55-75 | Greed | Optimistic, risk-on sentiment |
| 75-100 | Extreme Greed | Euphoria, potential market top |

**Contrarian use:** Many traders buy during Extreme Fear and reduce exposure during Extreme Greed.

## Altcoin Season Index

Measures whether altcoins or Bitcoin is leading the market.

### Methodology

1. Track the top 50 altcoins by market cap (excluding stablecoins)
2. Compare each altcoin's 90-day performance to Bitcoin's
3. Count how many altcoins outperformed BTC

### Calculation

```
Altcoin Season Score = (Outperformers / Total Altcoins) × 100
```

If 40 out of 50 altcoins outperformed Bitcoin → Score = 80 (Altseason)

### Interpretation

| Score | Label | What It Means |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| 0-25 | BTC Season | Bitcoin strongly outperforming |
| 25-40 | BTC Leaning | Bitcoin performing better |
| 40-60 | Neutral | Mixed performance |
| 60-75 | Alt Leaning | Altcoins performing better |
| 75-100 | Altseason | Altcoins strongly outperforming |

### Historical Patterns

- **Bull market peaks** often see extreme Altseason readings
- **Bear market bottoms** often see extreme BTC Season
- **Early bull markets** typically start with BTC Season

## BTC Dominance

Bitcoin's percentage share of the total cryptocurrency market cap.

### Calculation

```
BTC Dominance = (Bitcoin Market Cap / Total Crypto Market Cap) × 100
```

**Example:** If Bitcoin is worth $1T and total crypto is $2T → Dominance = 50%

### Data Source

Real-time market cap data aggregated from major exchanges and data providers.

### Interpretation

| Dominance | Trend | Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| Rising toward 60%+ | BTC strengthening | Flight to safety, bear market behavior |
| Stable 45-55% | Balanced | Normal market conditions |
| Falling toward 40% | Alts strengthening | Risk-on, altcoin speculation |
| Below 40% | Extreme | Usually indicates altcoin mania |

### Historical Context

- **2017 peak:** Fell below 35% during ICO mania
- **2018-2019 bear:** Rose above 70%
- **2021 peaks:** Dropped to ~40% during altcoin rallies
- **Current cycle:** Typically ranges 45-55%

## Contrarian Index

BlockMind's proprietary indicator for identifying potential market turning points.

### Methodology

The Contrarian Index combines leverage and positioning data to detect crowded trades:

**Inputs:**
1. **Aggregated Open Interest (OI)** — Total value of outstanding futures contracts
2. **Long/Short Ratio** — Binance trader positioning data
3. **Funding Rates** — Cost of holding leveraged positions

### Calculation Process

1. Calculate z-scores for each input (standard deviations from mean)
2. Weight and combine z-scores
3. Transform to 0-100 scale using: `50 + 50 × tanh(z-score / 1.25)`

### Why Z-Scores?

Z-scores normalize data across different magnitudes, allowing us to compare:
- "OI is 2 standard deviations above average"
- "Long/short ratio is 1.5 standard deviations below average"

### Interpretation

| Score | Label | Signal |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 0-25 | Extreme Fear | Contrarian **bullish** — market oversold |
| 25-45 | Fear | Below average positioning |
| 45-55 | Neutral | Balanced positioning |
| 55-75 | Greed | Above average positioning |
| 75-100 | Extreme Greed | Contrarian **bearish** — market overleveraged |

**Key insight:** Unlike Fear & Greed (which is directional), the Contrarian Index is specifically designed for contrarian trading — extreme readings suggest potential reversals.

## Data Quality & Limitations

### What We Do Well

- **Multiple data sources** — No single point of failure
- **Regular updates** — Indicators refresh throughout the day
- **Historical context** — 30+ days of history for trend analysis
- **Transparent methodology** — You know what you're looking at

### Limitations

1. **Lagging indicators** — By definition, sentiment follows price
2. **Not predictive** — These measure current state, not future direction
3. **Can stay extreme** — Markets can remain "irrational" for extended periods
4. **Data source changes** — API updates can temporarily affect readings

### Best Practices

1. **Use multiple indicators** — Don't rely on any single metric
2. **Consider timeframes** — Daily noise vs weekly trends
3. **Combine with your analysis** — Indicators inform, not dictate
4. **Watch for divergences** — When indicators disagree, dig deeper

## Update Schedule

| Indicator | Update Frequency |
|-----------|------------------|
| Fear & Greed | Every 6-8 hours |
| Altcoin Season | Daily |
| BTC Dominance | Real-time (minute-level) |
| Contrarian Index | Every 4 hours |
