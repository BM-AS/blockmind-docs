# Troubleshooting

Having trouble? Here are solutions to the most common issues.

## Wallet Connection Issues

### Wallet Won't Connect

**Symptoms:** Clicking "Connect Wallet" does nothing, or the modal appears but your wallet isn't listed.

**Solutions:**
1. **Refresh the page** — Sometimes a simple refresh fixes connection issues
2. **Check your wallet extension** — Make sure it's unlocked and active
3. **Try a different browser** — Some extensions work better in Chrome/Brave
4. **Disable conflicting extensions** — Multiple wallet extensions can conflict
5. **Clear browser cache** — Old cached data can cause issues

### Connection Stuck on "Connecting..."

**Symptoms:** The connection modal shows "Connecting..." but never completes.

**Solutions:**
1. **Check your wallet** — Open your wallet extension and look for a pending approval
2. **Reject and retry** — If stuck, reject in your wallet and try again
3. **Restart your browser** — Fully close and reopen
4. **Check network** — Ensure you're not on a VPN that blocks WebSocket connections

### Wrong Network

**Symptoms:** Wallet connects but shows wrong chain or no tokens.

**Solutions:**
1. **Switch networks in your wallet** — Make sure you're on the correct chain
2. **Add the network** — Some chains need to be manually added to your wallet
3. **Supported chains:** Ethereum, Base, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, BSC, Avalanche, Solana

## Token Display Issues

### Tokens Not Showing

**Symptoms:** You know you own tokens but they don't appear in BlockMind.

**Solutions:**
1. **Wait a moment** — New transactions can take a few minutes to index
2. **Re-scan your wallet** — Go to Portfolio and click refresh/rescan
3. **Check "suspicious tokens"** — Some tokens are filtered by default; toggle the filter
4. **Verify the chain** — Make sure you're looking at the right blockchain

### Token Shows Wrong Price or $0

**Symptoms:** A token appears but with incorrect or zero value.

**Solutions:**
1. **New tokens** — Very new tokens may not have price data yet
2. **Low liquidity tokens** — Illiquid tokens may have unreliable pricing
3. **Refresh** — Price data updates periodically; try refreshing
4. **Report it** — Email support@blockmind.app with the token details

### Spam/Scam Tokens Appearing

**Symptoms:** Random tokens you never bought appear in your portfolio.

**Solutions:**
1. **Don't interact with them** — Never try to sell or approve unknown tokens
2. **Toggle suspicious filter** — BlockMind filters known spam by default
3. **They're harmless** — These "airdrop scams" can't steal funds unless you interact

## Account Issues

### Can't Sign In

**Symptoms:** Email verification code doesn't arrive or doesn't work.

**Solutions:**
1. **Check spam folder** — Verification emails sometimes get filtered
2. **Wait a minute** — Emails can be delayed; wait before requesting another
3. **Check the email address** — Make sure you're using the same email you signed up with
4. **Try again** — Request a new code if the old one expired

### Session Expired

**Symptoms:** You get logged out unexpectedly.

**Solutions:**
1. **Sign in again** — Sessions expire for security; just sign back in
2. **Check browser settings** — Blocking cookies can cause session issues
3. **Private browsing** — Sessions won't persist in incognito/private mode

## DeepDive Issues

### Report Taking Too Long

**Symptoms:** DeepDive has been generating for more than 5 minutes.

**Solutions:**
1. **Wait a bit longer** — Complex tokens can take time to analyze
2. **Try again** — If stuck, close and request a new report
3. **Check your connection** — Reports won't load without internet

### Report Shows Old Data

**Symptoms:** Prices or metrics in the report seem outdated.

**Solutions:**
1. **Request a new report** — DeepDive generates fresh data each time
2. **Market hours** — Some data sources update less frequently on weekends

## Performance Issues

### Page Loading Slowly

**Symptoms:** BlockMind takes a long time to load or feels sluggish.

**Solutions:**
1. **Check your internet** — Slow connection affects load times
2. **Close other tabs** — Too many open tabs can slow your browser
3. **Clear cache** — Outdated cached files can cause issues
4. **Try a different browser** — Some browsers perform better

### Charts Not Loading

**Symptoms:** Chart areas show blank or loading spinners.

**Solutions:**
1. **Wait a moment** — Charts load data asynchronously
2. **Refresh the page** — Usually fixes rendering issues
3. **Check ad blockers** — Some ad blockers interfere with chart libraries
