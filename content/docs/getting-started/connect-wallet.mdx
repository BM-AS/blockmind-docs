# Connect a Wallet

BlockMind supports over 300 wallets across EVM chains (Ethereum, Base, Polygon, etc.) and Solana.

## Supported Wallets

- **MetaMask**
- **Phantom**
- **OKX Wallet**
- **Coinbase Wallet**
- **WalletConnect** (300+ wallets)
- And many more...

## How to Connect

1. Navigate to **Portfolio** → **Import Wallet**
2. Click **Connect Wallet**
3. Select your wallet from the modal
4. Approve the connection in your wallet
5. BlockMind will scan and import your holdings

## What Happens After Connecting?

Once connected, BlockMind will:

- **Scan your wallet** for all token holdings
- **Identify tokens** and match them with our database
- **Show you a preview** of what will be imported
- **Let you choose** to create a new portfolio or add to an existing one

## Manual Import Option

Don't want to connect? You can also:

1. Click **Or paste address manually**
2. Enter your wallet address
3. BlockMind will scan and show your holdings

This is completely read-only — we never have access to your keys.

## Troubleshooting

**Wallet not appearing?**
- Make sure your browser extension is installed and unlocked
- Try refreshing the page
- Check that you're on a supported chain

**Missing tokens?**
- Some tokens may not be in our database yet
- Very small balances may be filtered as dust
- Check the "suspicious tokens" toggle if you're looking for unverified tokens

## Next Steps

Now that your wallet is connected, explore your [portfolio dashboard](/docs/portfolio/overview) to see your holdings.
